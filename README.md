# VHDL model of the MC6821 Peripheral Interface Adapter                                     
                                                                           
## emulating the IC6821
One day my partern says lets make this old board smaller. But a lot of IC6821. So emulate them into an FPGA. So i developed the code in VHDL. The 6821 is a peripheral from MOTOROLA. It has two bidir ports PA,PB and four interrupt inputs, two of them also can be configured for handshake.
## Not time to write yet.

## Status early yet
-- On 16 december 2005 i finished the coding and some basing simulation using the QUARTUS web edition.
